Things to evaluate:
1. Whether or not to put word2vec as retrieval level match feature
2. tf-ifd caculation: stop words removal and low freq words removal
3. Which pre-trained word2vec to use.
4. Number of latent states in LDA


5. Performance of LDA is very stochastic. Need to re-run several times to get a good model.
Need to develop a method to evaluate.
